I am from Ahwaz, Iran. I fell in love with programming the first semester of college and haven't looked back!

One of my idols is [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam) and like him, I am a polymath; so programming is not my only love! I also enjoy writing, teaching and graphic design.
